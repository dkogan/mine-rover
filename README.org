* Overview

This is a set of tools to drive the mine rover. There's a generic single-board
computer (a Raspberry Pi 3b+ currently). I'm talking via I2C to a PCA9685-based
16-Channel 12-bit PWM board. The first 4 PWM channels each talk to a motor via
an XY-160D motor controller.

* Tools

This repo has a few tools

** Basic test

For the most basic testing you can run =pwm-init.sh= and then =pwm-set.sh= to
write arbitrary values to the motor controllers

** Full system

=motors.py= is a higher-level interface. Run the program, then each line of text
on STDIN is a command. Each command is one or two ascii numbers. The first
number is in [0,3]: the motor. The second number is in [-4095,4095]: the
velocity. 0 means "power hold". If the second number is missing, we release the
motor. If an empty line is given, we exit.
